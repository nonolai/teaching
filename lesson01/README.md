# lesson 1 - Intro and Setup

## Intro

Computer science is, as the name implies, the science of how computers work.
Programming is a tool that programmers use, but computer science is what informs
_what_ people program. In these lessons we'll go over some of the basics to
build fundamental CS knowledge.

## Prerequisites

For these you'll need `clang` and `git`.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository with:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/nonolai/teaching.git
    ```

1.  Change to the directory of the lesson you want to work on. In this case,
    lesson 1:

    ```shell
    cd teaching/lesson01
    ```

1.  To ensure your tools are all working properly, try to compile and run the
    sample code:

    ```shell
    clang sample.c
    ```

1.  This will produce an executable from your compiled code (by default named
    `a.out`). In the next lesson we'll dissect it, but for now running it
    should display a welcome message:

    ```shell
    ./a.out
    ```
